      Detailed Instructions
    </h2>
   
      <p>• Choose a circumstance/situation in your life for which you would like more clarity, self-empathy, and self-connection.
      </p>

      <p>• Write it in the space provided. Sit in silence a moment to consciously connect with your thoughts and emotions around this issue.  Proceed slowly with the next steps; breathing calmly/fully with body relaxed.
      </p>

      <p>• Explore your Feelings (emotions) by clicking on the deck of yellow cards with red heart; then dragging that top card to a placeholder below.  Note there are 70 total cards in the deck and 10 spaces to place your top priority cards.  
      </p>

      <p>• Next, explore your Needs/Values by clicking on the deck of red cards with yellow sun; and dragging that top card to a placeholder below where there are three categories of Needs/Values: very important, somewhat important, least important.
      Note there are 70 total cards in the deck and 40 spaces to place your top priority cards. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Left over cards are left in the field or in the deck.
      </p>

      <p>•  Continue to sit ‘in meditation’ with these Needs/Values cards. The practice is to connect with how much these Needs/Values matter to you, without blame or expectation that “someone should have satisfied these for you.”  
      </p>

      <p>•  After you have a “felt shift” in your body (more relaxed, calm, self-connected), check in with yourself to see if you have any requests you would now like to make of yourself or someone else.  Countless studies and experiments  have demonstrated that our actions, strategies, and problem solutions come easier and clearer when we first have experienced a genuine connection with our emotions and values.
      </p>

      <p>•  Choose to “save current game”  or “load game”  (which will automatically delete this current game)
      </p>

      <p>press "Save Text" to save anything put in the text boxes, and "Load Text" to load them back. press "Save" to save the current state of the cards in the field and "Load All" to load them back.  
      </p>
